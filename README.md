## üèéÔ∏è How does it work?

I wrote two articles about how I created Atidraw:
- [Code, Draw, Deploy: A drawing app with Nuxt & Cloudflare R2](https://hub.nuxt.com/blog/drawing-app-with-nuxt-and-cloudflare-r2)
- [Using Cloudflare AI Models for User Experience](https://hub.nuxt.com/blog/cloudflare-ai-for-user-experience)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
2. Set up your environment and fill the env variables
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    If you don't set the Google and GitHub credentials, anonymous sign-in will be enabled.
3. Create & link a NuxtHub project to enable running AI models on your Cloudflare account
    ```bash
    npx nuxthub link
    ```
4. Launch the dev server
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and start drawing!

## üìÅ Manage Drawings

You can manage the drawings (local or remote) within the Nuxt DevTools in the Hub Blob tab:

## ü§ñ Experiment with AI

Unlock the full potential of Atidraw by enabling the AI image generation feature:

   + <AIDraw :drawing="drawing" class="mt-4" />
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000/draw to draw something and click on "Draw with AI"
